We're now ready to provide some\nevidence for that claim.\n\n### Generic programming: binding-time analysis\n\nBinding-time analysis for generic functions is particularly simple.  Recall\nthat generic functions involve an additional parameter which describes the\nshape of data; for example, in the following signature for `gshow` the first\nargument of type `'a data` describes the type `'a` of the second argument:\n\n```\nval gshow : 'a data -> 'a -> string\n```\n\nSince the type at which generic functions is (generally) known during\ncompilation and the value is known only when the program runs, we will treat\ntype representations (arguments of type `'a data`) as static and other\narguments as dynamic.\n\nIn our previous implementation of generic programming we used type\nrepresentations to traverse values.  Since staging involves turning functions\ninto code generators our staged implementation of generic programming will use\ntype representations to generate code that traverses values.  Furthermore, the\ncode generated will not contain the type equality tests or interpretative\noverhead that make unstaged implementations of generic programming\ninefficient.\n\n### Target code\n\nHere is the signature of a typical staged generic function:\n\n```\nval gshow : 'a data -> ('a -> string) code\n```\n\nThe `gshow` function takes a type representation of type `'a data` that\ndescribes the type `'a`, and returns the code of a function that converts a\nvalue of type `'a` to a string.  For example, we might apply `gshow` to a\nrepresentation of the following tree type"},{"metadata":{},"input":"type tree =\n   Empty : tree\n | Branch : branch -> tree\nand branch = tree * int * tree","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"language":"python","collapsed":false},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nto generate code like this:"},{"metadata":{},"input":"let rec show_tree = function\n  Empty -> \"Empty\"\n| Branch b -> \"(Branch \"^ show_branch b ^\")\"\nand show_branch (l, v, r) =\n  show_tree l ^\", \"^ show_int v ^\", \"^ show_tree r\nand show_int i = string_of_int i","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"language":"python","collapsed":false},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nNote that the code we wish to generate contains no values of type `'a data`.\nIn fact, there is no indication that the code is \"generic\" at all: it is\nsimply the sort of printing function for trees that we might write by hand.\n\n### Generic programming recap\n\nThe [generic programming library](generic_programming.html) we looked at\ninvolved two type-indexed values, for type equality and type traversals.\n\nHere is the definition of the type `typeable`, a type-indexed value for type\nequality:"},{"metadata":{},"input":"type 'a typeable = {\n  type_rep : 'a type_rep;\n  eqty : 'b.

However, staging the final component of the\ngeneric programming library --- the high-level functions such as `everywhere`,\n`everything`, `gshow` and `gsize` --- introduces a fresh difficulty in the\nform of recursion.\n\nHere is the unstaged definition of the generic function `gshow`:\n\n```\nlet rec gshow : 'a. 'a data -> 'a -> string =\n  fun t v ->\n    \"(\"^ t.ctor v\n    ^ String.concat \" \" (t.gmapQ {q = gshow} v)\n    ^ \")\"\n```\n\nUp to this point we have treated recursion as something to be eliminated when\nstaging.  The staging of both `pow` and `dot` involved performing the\nrecursion statically to generate loop-free code.  However, we cannot perform\nthe recursion statically for `gshow`, which must generate code that can\noperate on recursively-defined data, such as lists and trees.  In fact, in the\ngeneral case, we must generate mutually-recursive functions such as\n`show_tree` and `show_branch` above, since we would like the staged library to\nsupport mutually-recursive data types.\n\n## Generating recursive definitions\n\nGenerating mutually-recursive definitions for `gshow` involves two challenges.\nFirst, `gshow` must be able to generate an arbitrary number of\nmutually-recursive functions, since the number of functions generated depends\non the number of mutually-recursive types represented by the `data` argument.\nSecond, the type representations may be *cyclic*: for example, the type\nrepresentation for `list` contains `list` as a sub-value.  These cycles\nrequire us to keep track of the types that we have already encountered while\ntraversing a type representation.\n\n### Mutually-recursive definitions\n\nGenerating an arbitrary number of mutually-recursive functions is difficult\nbecause MetaOCaml currently only supports quotations and splicing for\nexpressions, and a group of bindings is not an expression.  We would like to\nwrite\n\n```\nlet rec .~(bindings) in e\n```\n\nbut this would require `.~(bindings)` to expand to a syntax node of the form\n\n```\nx1 = e1 and x1 = e1 and ... and xn = en\n```\n\nwhich is not an expression in the OCaml grammar.  To work around the\ndifficulty we will use an encoding of recursion based on mutable references.\n\nWe can illustrate the reference-based approach with a pair of\nmutually-recursive functions that define (rather inefficient) predicates for\ntesting whether a number is even or odd:"},{"metadata":{},"input":"let rec evenp x =\n  x = 0 || oddp (pred x)\nand oddp x =\n  not (evenp x)","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"language":"python","collapsed":false},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nThe idea is to define `evenp` and `oddp` as reference cells which initially\ncontain \"dummy\" functions and then to fill in these cells with the actual\nfunctions at a later point.

We have reduced the problem of generating mutually-recursive\nfunctions to the simpler problem of generating the appropriate number of\nnon-recursive `let` bindings and assignments.\n\n\n### Let insertion\n\nWhile generating `let` bindings is simpler than generating `let rec` bindings,\nit is still not entirely trivial.  Staged functions often generate code that\nmirrors the structure of a value by traversing the value and generating an\nexpression for each subnode.  The need to introduce a `let` binding is often\ndiscovered during the traversal, but it is usually preferable to insert the\n`let` binding as high up as possible in the generated code to avoid repeated\ncomputation.\n\nThe `genlet` library supports `let` insertion through a simple interface.\nThere are two functions, `let_locus`, which marks a particular point in the\ncode where `let` bindings may be inserted\n\n```\nval let_locus : (unit -> 'w code) -> 'w code\n```\n\nand `genlet` which requests the insertion of a `let` binding:\n\n```\nval genlet : 'a code -> 'a code\n```\n\nHere is a simple example of `let` insertion in action:\n\n```\n< 1 +\n    .~(let_locus (fun () ->\n       .< 2 + .~(genlet .< 3 + 4 >.) >.)) >.\n```\n\nAnd here is the output:\n\n```\n  1 +\n    let x = 3 + 4 in\n    2 + x\n```\n\n(Unfortunately, the `genlet` library does not currently work inside IOCaml\nnotebooks, so this part of the notebook is not interactive.)\n\n### Let rec insertion\n\nWe can use `genlet` together with the technique for encoding recursion using\nreferences to build a library for `let rec` insertion.  Here is the definition\nof a `letrec` function, which is analogous to `genlet`\n\n```\nlet letrec : 'a 'b. (('a -> 'b) code -> ('a -> 'b) code) -> ('a -> 'b) code =\n  fun k ->\n  let r = genlet (.< ref (fun _ -> assert false) >.) in\n  let _ = genlet (.<.~r := .~(k .< ! .~r >.) >.) in\n  .< ! .~r >.\n```\n\nThe `letrec` function has a type typical of fixpoint combinators.  It\naccepts a single argument, namely a function that receives and returns\ncode for a function value, and it builds a recursive binding for that\nvalue.\n\nWe can use `letrec` to build mutually-recursive bindings for `oddp` and\n`evenp`:\n\n```\nlet evenp =\n  let_locus (fun () ->\n  letrec (fun evenp ->\n     let oddp = \n       letrec (fun oddp -> .< (fun x -> not (.~evenp x)) >.)\n     in\n    .< (fun x -> x = 0 || .~(oddp) (pred x)) >.))\n```\n\nThere are two calls to `letrec` in this program.  The first call generates the\nbinding for `evenp` and passes to its argument a variable `evenp` to be used\nfor recursive calls.  Similarly, the second call generates the binding for\n`oddp`, passing to its argument a variable `oddp` and a callback `def_oddp`.\n\nHere is the generated code for `evenp`:\n\n.<\nlet e = ref (fun _  -> assert false) in\nlet o = ref (fun _  -> assert false) in\nlet _ = o := (fun x_9  -> not ((! e) x_9)) in\nlet _ = e := (fun x_11  -> (x_11 = 0) || ((! o) (pred x_11))) in\n! e\n>."},{"metadata":{},"input":".<let e = ref (fun _ -> assert false) in\n  let o = ref (fun _ -> assert false) in\n  let _ = e := (fun x -> x = 0 || !o (x - 1)) in\n  let _ = o := (fun y -> y = 1 || not (!e y)) in\n    (!e, !o)>.","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"language":"python","collapsed":false},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n### Memoization\n\nIn order to handle cyclic type representations we will make use of an common\nfunctional programming technique known as memoization.

The `empty` and `add` functions\nconstruct an empty table and add an entry to an existing table respectively.\nFinally, `lookup` uses our generic type equality operator `=~=` to search the\ntable for a particular key, then returns the associated value.\n\n\n### Generating code for gshow\n\nWe are finally ready to turn `gshow` into a code generator.  We will start\nwith a function analogous to `memoize`, but which combines `let rec` insertion\nand polymorphic memoization:\n\n```\nlet memofix h =\n{ q = fun t ->\n  let tbl = ref empty in\n  let rec result d x = match lookup !tbl d with\n       Some f -> .< .~f .~x >.\n     | None ->\n        let g = letrec (fun self ->\n                  tbl := add !tbl d self;\n                  .< fun y -> .~(h result .<y>.) >.)\n         in .< .~g .~x >.\n```\n\nThe next step is to rewrite `gshow` in open-recursive style, as we did for\n`fib`:\n\n```\nlet gshow_gen : string genericQ -> string genericQ =\n    fun gshow ->\n      { q = fun data v ->\n             .< \"(\"^ .~(data.ctor v)\n              ^ String.concat \" \" .~((gmapQ gshow).q data v)\n              ^ \")\" >. }\n```\n\nFinally, we can \"tie the recursive knot\" by applying `memofix` to the\nopen-recursive `gshow`:\n\n```\nlet gshow = memofix gshow_gen\n```\n\nHere is the generated code for `gshow`:"},{"metadata":{},"input":"let show_tree = ref (fun _ -> assert false) in\nlet show_branch = ref (fun _ -> assert false) in\nlet show_int = ref (fun _ -> assert false) in\nlet _ = show_int :=\n fun i ->\n  \"(\"^ string_of_int i ^ String.concat \" \" [] ^\")\" in\nlet _ = show_branch :=\n  fun b ->\n   \"(\"^ \"(,)\"^\n        ((String.concat \" \"\n          (let (l,v,r) = b in\n           [!show_tree l; !show_int v; !show_tree r]))\n        ^\")\") in\nlet _ = show_tree :=\n  (fun t ->\n     \"(\"^ ((match t with Empty -> \"Empty\" \n                       | Branch _ -> \"Branch\") ^\n           ((String.concat \" \"\n               (match t with\n                | Empty -> []\n                | Branch b -> [!show_branch b])) ^\")\"))) in\n!show_tree","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"language":"python","collapsed":false},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n(While this code fulfils the original goals of avoiding interpretative\noverhead and runtime type-equality tests, there is still room for improvement.\nPossibly improvements include\n\n* Improving code generation for `gmapQ`.
