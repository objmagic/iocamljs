Abstraction helps to make\nprograms more general and more robust, but often comes with a performance\ncost.  *Staging* is one way of eliminating this cost, making it possible to\ncombine abstraction with efficiency.\n\n### Abstraction and optimization opportunities\n\nAbstraction can reduce the efficiency of a program in a number of ways.\nAbstraction boundaries sometimes make code harder for a compiler to optimize.\n\nHere is a definition of a function, `both_eq1`, which compares pairs of\nintegers for equality:\n\n```\nlet both_eq1 : int * int -> int * int -> bool =\n  fun (x1, y1) (x2, y2) ->\n   x1 = x2 && y1 = y2\n```\n\nThe OCaml compiler will compile `both_eq1` to efficient code, specializing\nsand inlining the polymorphic equality operation with an equality test that\noperates on values that are known to be integers.\n\nWe can make the function more general by abstracting the equality test.  Here\nis a second function, `both_eq2`, which accepts the integer equality test as\nan argument:\n\n```\nlet both_eq2 : (int -> int -> bool) ->\n  int * int -> int * int -> bool =\n  fun eq (x1, y1) (x2, y2) ->\n    eq x1 x2 && eq y1 y2\n```\n\nAnd here is a call to `both_eq2`, passing in the equality test as an argument:\n\n```\nboth_eq2 (=)\n```\n\nAs before, the OCaml compiler will inline and specialize the equality test in\nthis call.  However, calling a function passed as argument is less efficient\nthan calling a function directly, so `both_eq2` is less efficient than\n`both_eq1`.\n\nWe can introduce even more abstraction into the program by making the equality\nfunction passed as argument polymorphic.  OCaml doesn't support passing\npolymorphic functions directly, but we can pass a record with a polymorphic\nfield.  Here is a third implementation, `both_eq3`, which accepts such a\npolymorphic argument:\n\n```\ntype eq = { eq: 'a. 'a -> 'a -> bool }\nlet both_eq3 {eq} (x1, y1) (x2, y2) =\n  eq x1 x2 && eq y1 y2\n```\n\nAnd here is a call to `both_eq3`:\n\n```\nboth_eq3 { eq = (=) }\n```\n\nSince the equality function is passed as a polymorphic function rather than as\na function that operates on integers the OCaml compiler is unable to replace\nit with a type-specialized version, and so `both_eq3` is less efficient again\nthan `both_eq2`.\n\n### Interpretative overhead\n\n*Interpretative overhead* is a second way in which abstraction can make\nprograms less efficient.  Interpretative overhead occurs when a program must\nexamine a data structure in order to determine which action to perform.  For\nexample, the `printf` family of functions typically involve a certain amount\nof interpretative overhead, since they operate by interpreting a format string\nwhen the program runs.  Here is a function which prints out a pair of integers\nas a string using `printf`:"},{"metadata":{},"input":"let print_int_pair (x,y) =\n  Printf.printf \"(%d,%d)\" x y","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"language":"python","collapsed":false},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nThis function is less efficient than the following equivalent but less elegant\nimplementation, which simply calls a number of primitive functions directly:"},{"metadata":{},"input":"let print_int_pair2 (x,y) =\n  print_char '(';\n  print_int x;\n  print_char ',';\n  print_int y;\n  print_char ')'","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"language":"python","collapsed":false},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nAs with `both_eq`, we can also write even more general (and even less\nefficient) implementations by abstracting further.  Here is a definition of\n`print_int_pair` that uses the generic programming library introduced in the\nprevious lecture:\n\n```\nlet print_int_pair3 (x,y) =\n   print_string (gshow.q (pair int int) (x, y))\n```\n\nThis implementation is even less efficient than `print_int_pair` because there\nis an extra level of indirection: `gshow` is implemented in terms of `gmapQ`,\nwhich is difficult to optimize because it is so highly polymorphic.\n\n### Abstraction wants to be free\n\nLet's start with a simple example to see how staging can improve the\nefficiency of programs.

We\ncall the former variables *static* and the latter variables *dynamic*.\n\n### The idealized staging process:\n\nThe process of specializing a function using staging often follows the same\npattern:\n\n1. Write the program as usual, without staging constructs.\n\n   Here is the signature for an unstaged function with some static inputs (of\n   some type `t_sta`) and some dynamic inputs (of some type `t_dyn`):\n\n   ```\n   val program : t_sta -> t_dyn -> t\n   ```\n\n   In our original `pow` function all of `t_sta` (the exponent) and `t_dyn`\n   (the base) and `t` (the result type) were `int`.\n\n2. Add staging annotations, changing the dynamic variables into variables of\n   type `t_dyn code` and the output into type `t code`.\n\n   ```\n   val staged_program : t_sta -> t_dyn code -> t code\n   ```\n\n   At this point we have changed the original function into a code generator\n\n3. Compile the code using `back`:\n\n   ```\n   val back: ('a code -> 'b code) -> ('a -> 'b) code\n   ```\n\n   The `back` function turns a function from `code` to `code` into a closed\n   piece of code.  We might define `back` as follows:"},{"metadata":{},"input":"let back f = .< fun x -> .~(f .< x >.) >.","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"language":"python","collapsed":false},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n   There is a companion function `forth` of type\n\n   ```\n   val forth: ('a -> 'b) code -> 'a code -> 'b code\n   ```\n\n   whose definition is left as an exercise.\n\n   In the `pow` example above we didn't use `back` explicitly.  Instead\n   we inlined the definition of `back` in the function `pow_code`.\n\n   Combining `back` with the code generator of step 2 gives a function of type\n\n   ```\n   val code_generator : t_sta -> (t_dyn -> t) code\n   ```\n\n4. Construct the static inputs:\n\n   ```\n   val s : t_sta\n   ```\n\n   In order to generate code we must supply the static arguments to the code\n   generator.  In the `pow` example constructing the static arguments is easy,\n   since they're just integers.  In other cases this step can be more involved.\n\n5. Apply the code generator to static inputs:\n\n   ```\n   val specialized_code : (t_dyn -> t) code\n   ```\n\n   Applying the `code_generator` function to the static inputs produces a piece\n   of specialized code.\n\n6. Run the specialized code to build a specialized function:\n\n   Running (evaluating) the code generated in the previous step produces a\n   function that can be used in the program:\n\n   ```\n   val specialized_function : t_dyn -> t\n   ```\n\nIn practice, generating optimal code often involves more than simply adding\nstaging annotations --- we must change the program to make it more amenable to\nstaging.\n\n## Inner product\n\nLet's look at a second example.  Here is a function `dot` which computes the\ndot-product (also called the \"inner product\") of two vectors.
